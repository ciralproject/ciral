# 沍 CIRAL

CIRAL (Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval for African Languages) is a test collection focused on promoting the research and evaluation of Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval (CLIR) for African languages. Our collection covers cross-lingual retrieval between English and 4 African languages, with queries in English and passages in the African languages. This repo provides details of the test collection, guidelines for system evaluations and baselines.

Hosted as a track at the Forum for Information Retrieval Evaluation (FIRE) 2023, the goal of our track was to promote participation and community evaluations in CLIR for African languages.
More information regarding the track can be found at the website: [Ciral@Fire2023](https://ciralproject.github.io/)

<!-- CIRAL (Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval for African Languages) is a track at the Forum for Information Retrieval Evaluation (FIRE) 2023, focused on promoting the research and evaluation of Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval (CLIR) for solely African languages. A goal of the track is to develop the first human-annotated ad-hoc CLIR test collections for African languages, starting off with 4 languages and subsequent addition of others. This repo provides details of the test collection and guidelines for the task. -->

## 沒 Corpora

The current languages in CIRAL are Hausa, Swahili, Somali and Yoruba. The corpora consists of passages from news articles, mined from indigenous websites of the different languages.

Statistics and details of the collection are found below.

| Language        | News Sources                           | # of Passages | # of Articles | Link |

For each language, passages are stored in [JSONL](https://jsonlines.org/) files where each line corresponds to a passage in JSON format. The fields provided for each passage include:
-  `docid`: Unique identifier of the passage
- `title`: Title of the news article from which the passage was extracted
- `text`: Text of the passage
- `url`: News article url


## 沒 Queries and Relevance Judgements

CIRAL's queries and relevance judgements are provided for the four languages in three sets: development set, test set A and  test set B. Additionally, test set A consists of pools curated from CIRAL's shared task.
The queries and relevance judgement files can be accessed in the [Hugging Face repo](https://huggingface.co/datasets/CIRAL/ciral).

Statistics for the queries and relevance judgements are given below. The development set consists of few samples to analyze relevance and evaluate proposed systems using the provided judgements. 

|   | Dev | | Test A | | | Test B | | |
|:-------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:-------:|:------:|
| **Language**  | **#Q** | **#J** | **#Q** | **#J** | **Pool Size** | **#Q** | **#J** | **Link** |
| Hausa (ha)  | 10 | 165 | 80 | 1,447 | 7,288 | 312 | 5,930 | [洟余(https://huggingface.co/datasets/CIRAL/ciral/tree/main/ciral-hausa)| 
| Somali (so)    | 10 | 187 | 99 | 1,798 | 9,094 | 239 | 4,324 | [洟余(https://huggingface.co/datasets/CIRAL/ciral/tree/main/ciral-somali) | 
| Swahili (sw)   | 10 | 196 | 85 | 1,656 | 8,079 | 113 | 2,175 | [洟余(https://huggingface.co/datasets/CIRAL/ciral/tree/main/ciral-swahili) | 
| Yoruba (yo)    | 10 | 185 | 100 | 1,921 | 8,311 | 554 | 10, 569 | [洟余(https://huggingface.co/datasets/CIRAL/ciral/tree/main/ciral-yoruba) |

Both query and relevance judgements files are in the `.tsv` format. Each line in the query file is represented as:

```
qid\tquery
```

while the judgements are in the standard TREC format:

```
qid Q0 docid relevance
```


## 沒 Guidelines and Resources

#### Task Description
This task entails queries formulated as natural language questions in English, and retrieval done at the passage-level for the different African languages. Information retrieval systems developed for the task will receive the collection of passages and a set of queries for the different African languages. For each query in the test set, proposed systems are to return a ranked list of passages ordered by likelihood of binary relevance to the query. Up to 1000 passages per query can be submitted, results with more than 1000 would be truncated.

Details regarding participation can be found in this [section](https://ciralproject.github.io/#participation) of the website.


#### Getting started with IR and CIRAL

## 沐 Baselines and Evaluation

Baselines and reproduction guides are provided in this section. Please note that this only covers searching, as the indexes have already been built. <!--Add links to reproduce indexes.-->

The baselines can be reproduced using [Pyserini](https://github.com/castorini/pyserini). This would require:
- Installing the development version of Pyserini by following this [guide](https://github.com/castorini/pyserini/blob/master/docs/installation.md#development-installation).
- Copying the topic and qrel files from the [Hugging Face repo](https://huggingface.co/datasets/CIRAL/ciral) to `tools/topics-and-qrels` in the cloned `Pyserini` repo. 

```bash
git clone https://huggingface.co/datasets/CIRAL/ciral
cp -r ciral/*/*/* $PYSERINI_PATH/tools/topics-and-qrels/
```
