# 沍 CIRAL

CIRAL (Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval for African Languages) is a track at the Forum for Information Retrieval Evaluation (FIRE) 2023, focused on promoting the research and evaluation of Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval (CLIR) for solely African languages. A goal of the track is to develop the first human-annotated ad-hoc CLIR test collections for African languages, starting off with 4 languages and subsequent addition of others. This repo provides details of the test collection and guidelines for the task.

More information regarding the track can be found at the website: [Ciral@Fire2023](https://ciralproject.github.io/)



## 沒 Corpora

The focus languages in this first implementation of the task are Hausa, Swahili, Somali and Yoruba. The corpora consists of passages from news articles, mined from indigenous websites of the different languages.

Statistics and details of the collection are found below.

| Language        | News Sources                           | # of Passages | # of Articles | Link |
|:-------|:------------|:-------:|:-------:|:----:|
| Hausa (hau)     | LegitNG, DailyTrust, VOA, Isyaku, etc. |       715,355 |       240,883 | [洟余(https://huggingface.co/datasets/CIRAL/ciral-corpus/tree/main/passages-v1.0)
| Swahili (swa)   | VOA, Tuko, Risaala, Caasimada, etc.    |       981,658 |       146,669 | [洟余(https://huggingface.co/datasets/CIRAL/ciral-corpus/tree/main/passages-v1.0)
| Somali (som)    | VOA, UN Swahili, MTanzania, etc.       |     1,015,567 |       629,441 | [洟余(https://huggingface.co/datasets/CIRAL/ciral-corpus/tree/main/passages-v1.0)
| Yoruba (yor)    | Alaroye, VON, BBC, Asejere, etc.       |        82,095 |        27,985 | [洟余(https://huggingface.co/datasets/CIRAL/ciral-corpus/tree/main/passages-v1.0)


For each language, passages are stored in [JSONL](https://jsonlines.org/) files where each line corresponds to a passage in JSON format. The fields provided for each passage include:
-  `docid`: Unique identifier of the passage
- `title`: Title of the news article from which the passage was extracted
- `text`: Text of the passage
- `url`: News article url


## 沒 Queries and Relevance Judgements

The CIRAL queries and relevance judgements are provided for each of the four languages in two sets: development (currently named as Train) and test sets. They can be accessed in the [Hugging Face repo](https://huggingface.co/datasets/CIRAL/ciral)

Statistics for the Train queries and relevance judgements are given below. Th train set consists of few samples to analyze relevance and evaluate proposed systems using the provided judgements. 

Statistics for the collection would be completed after **pooling**.

| Language  | # Train Queries | # Train Judgements | Link |
|:-------|:---:|:-------:|:------:|
| Hausa (ha)  | 10 | 165 | [洟余(https://huggingface.co/datasets/CIRAL/ciral/tree/main/ciral-hausa)| 
| Swahili (sw)   | 10 | 196 | [洟余(https://huggingface.co/datasets/CIRAL/ciral/tree/main/ciral-swahili) | 
| Somali (so)    | 10 | 187 | [洟余(https://huggingface.co/datasets/CIRAL/ciral/tree/main/ciral-somali) | 
| Yoruba (yo)    | 10 | 185 | [洟余(https://huggingface.co/datasets/CIRAL/ciral/tree/main/ciral-yoruba) |

Both query and relevance judgements files are in the `.tsv` format. Each line in the query file is represented as:

```
qid\tquery
```

while the judgements are in the standard TREC format:

```
qid Q0 docid relevance
```


## 沒 Guidelines and Resources

The task entails cross-lingual information retrieval with queries formulated as natural language questions in English, and retrieval done at the passage-level for the different African languages. Information retrieval systems developed for the task will receive the collection of passages and a set of test queries for the different African languages. For each query in the test set, the systems return a ranked list of passages ordered by likelihood of binary relevance to the query. Up to 1000 passages per query can be submitted, results with more would be truncated.

Details regarding participation can be found in this [section](https://ciralproject.github.io/#participation) of the website.

For more details on understanding and getting started with the task, please check the provided [Guidelines and Resources](Guidelines/README.md)



## 沐 Baselines: Reproducing BM25 Batch Retrieval

BM25 baselines for CIRAL can be reproduced using [Pyserini](https://github.com/castorini/pyserini) and the following steps:
- Install the development version of Pyserini according to these [guide](https://github.com/castorini/pyserini/blob/master/docs/installation.md#development-installation). This also includes installing [Anserini](http://anserini.io/)
- Using the following commands, copy the topic and qrel files from the [Hugging Face repo](https://huggingface.co/datasets/CIRAL/ciral) to `tools/topics-and-qrels` in the cloned `Pyserini` repo. 

```bash
git clone https://huggingface.co/datasets/CIRAL/ciral
cp -r ciral/*/*/* $PYSERINI_PATH/tools/topics-and-qrels/
```
